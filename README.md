## The Drift Chamber

The drift chamber is an example of a wire chamber that have been used in high energy physics since the 1960s, specifically it is used to detect ionising radiation and recontruct the paths of incident high energy radiation. Here the performance of a drift chamber is simulated in the context of the detection of cosmics rays. At altitudes ~ sea level the majority of cosmic rays are muons and so here it is assumed that all incident radiation are muon particles. 

## Monte Carlo Treatment of Cosmic Ray Muons

Incident cosmic ray muons were simulated in a monte carlo fashion, making extensive use of the random library from Numpy.
