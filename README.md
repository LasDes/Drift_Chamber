## The Drift Chamber

The drift chamber is an example of a wire chamber that have been used in high energy physics since the 1960s. Specifically it is used to detect ionising radiation and recontruct the paths of incident high energy radiation. Here the performance of a drift chamber is simulated in the context of the detection of cosmics rays. At altitudes ~ sea level the majority of cosmic rays are muons and so here it is assumed that all incident radiation are muon particles.

## Monte Carlo Treatment of Cosmic Ray Muons

Incident cosmic ray muons were simulated in a monte carlo fashion, predominantly making use of the random function from the Numpy random library. Here we are interested in mapping the uniform probability distribution on the interval \[0, 1) provided by the random function to a general pdf P(y) on some specified interval between  $y_0$ and $y_1$. In order for this to work we require that the CDFs (cumulative density functions) are equal
